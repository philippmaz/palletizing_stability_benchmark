# PLP Loading Stability Benchmark 

This project contains all scripts around my [benchmark study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4778113): Standing on a common ground: A comparison of static stability approaches for pallet loading.
The data can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/uploads/13323774).
The code is organized as follows.

| Folder / Script                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `/00_benchmark`                                     | The folder contains the Msc ADAMS benchmark simulation code. We tracked a number of features during the simulation (e.g. forces, positions, rotations).                                                                                                       |
| `/01_masterdata`                                    | The folder contains masterdata, such as ULD mappings (our format <-> external format), item placeholder information, and the set of static stability approaches to test.                                                                                      |
| `/02_analysis`                                      | The folder contains the analysis in R of the data. We preprocessed the raw simulation results, since they contained too many information. We tracked the translations and rotations of items and stored the maximum value for each item-sequence-observation. |
| `01a_extract_ULDs_from_ACLPP_data.ipynb`            | The notebook reads in the [ACLPP dataset](https://github.com/fbrandt/ACLPP/tree/master) and transform it to single ULDs in our json format (with items, ULD information, etc.).                                                                               |
| `01b_extract_ULDs_from_Ali_data.ipynb`              | The notebook reads and transform the instances from [Ali et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494623011869) to our json format.                                                                                              |
| `02_ceil_weight.ipynb`                              | The notebooks sets a minimal weight on the items, which was necessary due to unrealistic simulation results.                                                                                                                                                  | 
| `03_transform_COM.ipynb`                            | The notebook creates the two complexity scenarios S2a and S2b by adding a center of mass according to a Gaussian and uniform distribution along the item's dimensions.                                                                                        | 
| `04_create_AeJob.ipynb `                            | The notebook transforms the ULD to a job json file that we need to process the data. Further, we add the assessment criteria (i.e. static stability appraoches).                                                                                              | 
| `05_execute_AeJob.ipynb`                            | We execute the jobs on a deployed server and collect the resulting static stability score and runtime.                                                                                                                                                        | 
| `06a_helper_add_assessment_criteria_to_job.ipynb`   | A helper script that updates the assessment criteria for the jobs (so we do not lose our CoM distribution, which we unfortunately did not random-seed..)                                                                                                      | 
| `06b_helper_split_AeJobs.ipynb`                     | A helper script that uses a self coded jar app to select jobs based on a maximal number of items. This was necessary, since the simulations took forever for larger (i.e., contain more items) layouts.                                                       | 
| `config.dist`                                       | Must be transformed to a config.py that contains the URL of API to test the stability approaches                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Select-Files.jar`                                  | The jar script that selects and copies jobs with a maximum number of items. It is used in the `06b_helper_split_AeJobs.ipynb` notebook.                                                                                                                                                   |
